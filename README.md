# Employee Churn: Salifort Motors Model Prediction
This is a capstone project useful for completing the course: **Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate**.

**Performed:** Data Cleaning, EDA, Data Visualization, Logistic Regression, and Tree-based Models (Decision Tree and Random Forest).

### Understand the business scenario and problem

The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. They refer to you as a data analytics professional and ask you to provide data-driven suggestions based on your understanding of the data. They have the following question: what’s likely to make the employee leave the company?

**My goal for this project is to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.**
